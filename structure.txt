WaveRNN seems competetive with latest end-to-end wave nets

TTS Model needs to:
* Be trained trained on multiple different languages and be able to extract between them
* Have a smooth latent space for the speaker (maybe a latent space for language and speaker combination?)

Translation model needs to:
* Be trained on the ??? being about equally long for input and answer

Is there a way to merge the STT, translation and TTS??
